# Description
Our project envisions an intelligent platform that seamlessly transforms provided materials into dynamic flashcards, eliminating the manual creation process. By automating study set generation, we empower students and learners to focus fully on what matters most: mastering their subjects and enhancing their knowledge, without the distraction of organizing study aids. This vision aims to redefine the study experience, making it more efficient, engaging, and ultimately, more effective for each user.
